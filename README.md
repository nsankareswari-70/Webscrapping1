### Webscraping
Project Description:
1. HVAC Dealer Information Collection
   The project involves scraping state-wise dealer information for leading HVAC manufacturers—Trane, Lennox, and Johnson Controls—from their respective dealer-locator portals.    
    2. Restaurant Research for Business Meetings in New York City
       Using TripAdvisor, the project identifies and compiles a curated list of 20 top-rated restaurants in New York City suitable for meetings. The process includes scraping restaurant ratings, reviews, location details, cuisine type, amenities, and relevance to professional gatherings. These results form a refined dataset that supports corporate planning, client engagement strategies, and hospitality research.
       3. Run Club Directory Compilation from RRCA

The project also gathers recreational and community-based fitness information by extracting details of 30 running clubs across various U.S. states from the Road Runners Club of America (RRCA.org) directory. Data points include club names, locations, and contact information. The collected information is recorded in a structured Google Sheets file for easy access and collaboration.
